                  A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk
                  by a web page server to uniquely identify your browser or to
                  store information in your browser. Cookies cannot be used to
                  run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. A “web
                  beacon” links web pages to servers and may be used to transmit
                  information collected through cookies back to a web server.
                  Most cookies expire after a certain period of time depending
                  on what they are used for. NftHost.app uses both first-party
                  cookies (which are set by our website when it is being
                  visited) and third-party cookies (which are set by a server
                  located outside the domain of our website).

                  Essential Cookies - Certain cookies are necessary in order for
                  NftHost.app&apos;s website to operate properly. For example,
                  we use cookies to authenticate you. When you log on to our
                  platform, authentication cookies are set which let us know who
                  you are during a browsing session. These cookies also
                  facilitate the social media login functionality (e.g., via
                  Facebook, Google, or GitHub) on our website, when added.
                  Essential cookies do not include advertising cookies, which
                  are discussed further below.

                  Analytics Cookies - Through our service providers, we may use
                  analytics to collect information about your use of the
                  NftHost.app website to create reports and statistics on the
                  performance of the website. Analytics collect information such
                  as your IP address, type of device, operating system,
                  geolocation, referring URLs, time and date of page visits, and
                  which pages you visit. The information allows us to quantify
                  our audience size, see the overall patterns of usage on the
                  platform, help us record any difficulties you have with the
                  website, and show us whether our advertising is effective or
                  not.

                  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most
                  desktop web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
                  usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you
                  prefer. You&apos;ll want to refer to your browser&apos;s help
                  section to do this since the instructions are usually
                  browser-specific. Mobile devices typically allow you to
                  control cookies through their system settings. Refer to your
                  device manufacturer&apos;s instructions for more information
                  on how to do this. If you choose to decline cookies, you may
                  not be able to fully experience the interactive features of
                  the NftHost.app services.
